## 📚 How It Works

### **Before (Generic AI)**
```
You: "How should I study for my exams?"
AI: "Create a study schedule, review notes regularly, practice problems..."
```
❌ Generic advice that applies to anyone

### **After (Context-Aware AI)**
```
You: "How should I study for my exams?"
AI: "For your Semester 3 courses (Data Structures, DBMS, Operating Systems), 
     focus on practical implementation for Data Structures, SQL queries for DBMS, 
     and process scheduling algorithms for OS. Practice coding daily!"
```
✅ Personalized advice based on YOUR courses!
